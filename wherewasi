  In the middle of transmogrifying things to use flow_run_steps intead of the flow_run itself for state.
  
  Next will need to make sure the watcher.py does what it should (write logs, track state in the db)
    * also minimize repetitive writes by comparing the state in the db
  
  Then figure out how to expose the state in a live way to the client (either a long streaming GET or websockets)

  


  need to implement logging with automatic rotation
